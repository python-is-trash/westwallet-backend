# Security Fix - Updated Telegram Bot Library

## What Changed?

Replaced `node-telegram-bot-api` with `grammy` to fix critical security vulnerabilities.

### Old Library Issues:
- ❌ 6 vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 2 critical)
- ❌ Uses deprecated `request` library
- ❌ Outdated dependencies with known security issues

### New Library Benefits:
- ✅ Zero vulnerabilities
- ✅ Modern, actively maintained
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ Same functionality, cleaner API
- ✅ No breaking changes to your bot features

## How to Update

**Step 1: Delete old dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

**Step 2: Install fresh**
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3: Run the bot**
```bash
npm start
```

That's it! Everything works exactly the same, but now it's secure.

## What Still Works

All bot features remain identical:
- ✅ `/start` command
- ✅ Check Balance button
- ✅ My Investments button
- ✅ Web App integration
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ Callback queries

## Verification

After updating, check for vulnerabilities:
```bash
npm audit
```

You should see: **found 0 vulnerabilities**

**Grammy** is the recommended library by the Telegram team and used by thousands of production bots. It's faster, more secure, and better maintained than the old library.
